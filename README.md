# Vue Material Design Icon Components

This library is a collection of single-file components to render Material
Design Icons.

## Getting started

```bash
$ npm install --save vue-material-design-icons
```

OR

```bash
$ yarn add vue-material-design-icons
```

Then import wherever you'd like to use the icon, and declare it as a local component:

```javascript
import MenuIcon from 'vue-material-design-icons/menu.vue'

components: {
  MenuIcon
}
```

Then use it in your code!

```html
<menu-icon />
```
